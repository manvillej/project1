                For this project, I satisfied all the technical requirements, but I wasn't sure what to do content wise. I decided the boiler plate biography would be a good place to start. Structure wise, there are 4 pages: an index, past, present, and future. I also have links to my twitter, the repo for the project, and my github profile from every page.

                I am proud of this. This is the first static page I've made that I would say looks good. I designed it in such a way that it could be compatible with the Jinja2 templating in Flask. Thinking of the system as individual modular parts changed how I thought about constructing the UI. I designed the UI that parts could be moved around, copied, and replaced. I think later on once we do the integrate Flask and a back end, I will be able to create my own (local) blog. I am not sure how to host yet, but I already see the parts falling together.

            <p> FYI, the tables, lists, and images are all filler data. I needed them for the requirements and I liked styling them, but I didn't have any content for them.</p>
